-- Notes from Chris --

Anything between a less than exclamation point dash dash, as you see at the top here, and dash dash greater than, as you see right below here, will be treated as a comment, and thus not appear in the display. This can be super handy to try things and turn them on and off while you experiment by removing the two things.

You can have as many as you want.
