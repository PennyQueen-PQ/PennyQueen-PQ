-- Notes from Chris --

Anything between a less than exclamation point dash dash, as you see at the top here, and dash dash greater than, as you see right below here, will be treated as a comment, and thus not appear in the display. This can be super handy to try things and turn them on and off while you experiment by removing the two things.

### The Penny Queen investment philosophy

I look for companies that are undervalued, generally unknown and possess disruptive or innovative technology that improves the world in some way.  Ideally, I find them before their first big move, but I am happy to get in on the second or third wave if it still makes sense.  Because of this, many of my favorite stocks are still trading on the OTC or the Canadian equivalent the CSE.  I believe in doing a deep dive into the technology of any company I invest in, I speak to executives, explore the current and potential financial situation and I tell everyone who will listen when I find something amazing.

My goal is to create a solid community of  investors willing to tackle the research with me.  We don't all need to be subject matter experts, we just need to be willing to learn and listen.   I call my method Deep Diligence, rather than due diligence.  I think the process is continuous and relies on investigation of catalysts , threats and technical analysis.  I personally will not cover any stock in which the representatives of the company will not communicate with me. 

As a side note, I cannot be bought - I managed to turn 330k into over 5.5 million in under a year, you will never see any paid endorsements here.  I still work for a living as a fire officer, because I find my work deeply rewarding and because I need to set a positive example for my children.  I am currently working on establishing the safety net for the next few generations of my family.
